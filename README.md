# CrowdStrike Nmap Takehome Project

Web application that uses user input to perform Nmap scans

## Disclaimers (Please Read)

This project uses the Django Web Framework, so there is third party library code within this project that I do not wish to take credit for. The business logic, of course, is my own. 

The CSS is also borrowed from public sources, because I do not intend to showcase front end design skills with this project. Credit to: https://github.com/thelearn-tech/hacker-theme
