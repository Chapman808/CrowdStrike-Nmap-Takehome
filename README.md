# Nmap Online (CrowdStrike Takehome Project)

Web application that uses user input to perform Nmap scans

## Disclaimers (Please Read)

This project uses the Django Web Framework, so there is third party library code within this project that I do not wish to take credit for. The business logic, of course, is my own. 

The CSS is also borrowed from public sources, because I do not intend to showcase front end design skills with this project. I did make some minor modifications to the css. **Credit to: https://github.com/thelearn-tech/hacker-theme**

These steps assume Python3 is already installed and you are running on an Ubuntu/Debian machine (Centos/Redhat should work fine, but package manager commands will differ)

1. clone this repo
2. install django


check if django is already installed: ```python -m django --version```
